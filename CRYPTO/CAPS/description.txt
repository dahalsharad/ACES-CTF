POINTS: 50

As I stood over the deathbed of a wealthy man, he handed me a mysterious code with a desperate plea for me to decipher it. He revealed that the code held the key to unlocking his crypto wallet, containing a fortune in Bitcoin. But there's a catch, I have only one chance left to crack the code before the account is locked forever, and with it, my chance to claim the riches. The weight of this opportunity and the stakes of failure are overwhelming, every second feels like an eternity as I race against time to unlock the secrets of the code.
Can you help me uncover the password and share the fortune, or will you let it slip through our grasp forever?
This is your only chance.
