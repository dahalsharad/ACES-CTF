The police are on the hunt for a ruthless killer, but the suspect has vanished without a trace. No social media trail, no leads - nothing. Only a message was found, "I find social media to be a soul-sucking void of meaningless affirmation.". But then, the investigation leads to a new direction, a website with the suspect's information was found. A website that may be the final clue to find the evil behind the heinous crime. The website address is http://95.216.141.221:8080/suspect/
