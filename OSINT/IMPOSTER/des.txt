Something sinister is afoot in the office. For the past few days, my colleagues and I have been receiving a lot of spam emails. But this is no ordinary spam, it's an elaborate ruse crafted by an imposter hiding in plain sight. My suspicions are aroused and I can't shake off the feeling that the culprit is someone among us.
Can you help me unmask the imposter and reveal their true identity before it's too late?
Below is the snap of email we got.
